## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries

### What I learned

I have the opportunity to learn how to place contents and items at the center using grid.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to fine tune my understanding of Grid and media queries
